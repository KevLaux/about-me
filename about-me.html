      <h1>Hello, My Name is Kevin Laux</h1>

      <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
      <p>I'm currently a student in Web Development 2 at Raritan Valley Community College working towards my degree. I've taken numerous programming courses and this will be the last one I take before I graduate. My biggest hobby has to be gaming, of which makes up a decent chunk of my free
        time. It was the fact that I spent so much of my time on and around computers that got me into the field to begin with.</p>

      <article>
        While I initially started out looking to be focused purely on coding, I came to realize that Web Development was a much more enjoyable experience.

      <h2>My Experiences</h2>
      <p>I've taken courses that have worked with Java, HTML, CSS, and a small amount of JavaScript.
